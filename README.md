Purpose
-------

### In the Name

> A mechane or machine was a crane used in Greek theatre… Made of wooden beams and pulley systems, the device was used to lift an actor into the air, usually representing flight. This stage machine was particularly used to bring gods onto the stage from above, hence the Latin term deus ex machina (“god out of the machine”).

### Modular, Computerized Winch or Motor System

Mechane consists of fist-sized, wireless winch/motor modules and a Bluetooth/USB interface block. The modules are designed to work individually or collaboratively in groups, moving objects through space under the command of a nearby phone, tablet, laptop, or PC, or remotely over the Internet. One module gives 1 dimension of movement, to pull window blinds or pan a camera, for example. Two modules give two dimensions of movement, to create a drawbot or pan and tilt a camera. Three or more modules give full three dimensional movement, to carry small objects to arbitrary x, y, and z coordinates like in this project from Penn State University.

Origin
------

Mechane started as a project to create a modular, wireless, easy-to-use drawbot system called [2doodle](http://2doodle.us/) for the [HackMIT hackathon](http://www.hackmit.org/).
