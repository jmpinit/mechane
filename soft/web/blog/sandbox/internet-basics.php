			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span>To your average programmer, the ways of the internet probably seem like common sense. However, to the non-programmers out there, the inner workings of the web can be baffling; so let's take a trip down metaphor lane to avoid any potential confusion. <br><br>

			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span><b>In a sense, an 'internet' has existed for hundreds of years,</b> it has just gotten a whole lot faster as of late: If you are like any other person from the late 1800's, you have probably used a mail order catalogue, but let's break down what's actually going on here.<br><br>

			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span>On one particularly fine afternoon, Ethel was lounging around the house when she decided to pull out her Sears catalogue to buy the fancy new electric radio she’d been eyeing. Little did she know, she simultaneously became the subject of a beautiful extended metaphor. <br><br>

			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span>Ethel filled out and mailed her order form, <i>violently</i> anxious for her delivery. The mail man collected her letter, giving Ethel a knowing nod as he drove away, and that letter made it’s way to the Sears headquarters in Chicago for processing. A worker read the order, walked around the Sears warehouse to gather the necessaries, and prepared the product for shipping.<br><br>

			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span>The mail man returned and the radio began it’s trek back to Ethel. A few days later, with a squeak of joy, Ethel noticed a package on her doorstep. She ripped apart the packaging, and began to follow the instructions to set up the radio set. In no time, Louis Armstrong rang throughout the room, and Ethel sat back to admire her handiwork.<br><br>

			<i>Ethel is not real.</i> <br><br>

			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span>Ethel is an <b>internet browser,</b> Sears is a <b>server,</b> the product catalogue is a <b>search engine,</b> and the postal service is the system of <b>modems, routers,</b> and so on that connect you to a server. <br><br>

			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span>Everything that Ethel did is called <b>“client side,”</b> and everything that Sears did is called <b>“server side.”</b> Client side “scripts” are instructions that your browser completes (often written with the language <b>JavaScript</b>), and server side scripts are instructions that the server you're communicating with completes (often written with the language <b>PHP</b>). <br><br>

			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span>Your computer and the servers <b>‘hosting’</b> a website you access communicate in very basic text files, which are merely descriptions of what the browser should draw on the screen; along the lines of “make a big red box that says ‘hello world’ inside of it.” These visual instructions are written with <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b> which is structure, and <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b>, which is the styling of that structure.<br><br>

			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span>In summation:<br><br>

			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span><b>HTML:</b> The structure of anything on the web. It’s a description of what a page should look like.<br><br>
			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span><b>CSS:</b> The style of the structure, works in conjunction with HTML.<br><br>
			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span><b>PHP:</b> A server side scripting language, used to pull information from a database, process forms, anything on the server.<br><br>
			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span><b>JavaScript:</b> A client side scripting language, executed by an internet browser to do things like animate onscreen elements, define what happens when a button is pressed, etc.<br><br>
			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span><b>Server:</b> A computer that stores files and sends them to your browser when requested, as well as execute server side scripts.<br><br>
			<span style="margin-left:60px;"></span><b>Browser:</b> A program that decodes HTML/CSS and executes other instructions from client side scripts.<br><br>
